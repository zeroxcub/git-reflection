## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to share your code with someone else or to a team
- when you want a **anywhere** and **anytime** accessible safe repository
    
### git remote command
- `git remote` list all remote repository (like `git branch` to list all branches)
- `git remote add origin #git_remote_url` add a remote repository called origin (whatever name you wish) at the url

-----------------

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
to avoid merge conflict in an intermediate repository state

### git push/pull command
push or pull to/from the remote repository using
`git push/pull origin master` where the origin is the name of the remote repository and the branch you want to push/pull
